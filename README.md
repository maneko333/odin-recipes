# Recipe HTML Site
A little site made for the Odin Project. This is to showcase basic HTML skills while tracking versions using Git. Everything relating to file management has been done using the terminal only. The site will have a homepage with some additional links leading to different recipes.

### Reflection
To be completed after finishing the project.
